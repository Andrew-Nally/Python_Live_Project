# Python_Live_Project
A project offered at the The Tech Academy in the Full Stack  Software Development Program

THe Python Live Project was one of 2 projects I participated while attending the Tech Academ
This project in summary, was to give the students a real-life work experience as a software ndeveloper working with a team of other developers to create a web scraper application using Python's Django framewoke.

Each student was to create their own app to be added to the collaborative site, each selecting different frontend
and backend stories to be completed before the two weeks were finished. The experience taught me how to work closely 
with a team of develoopers, how to overcome the challenges and road blocks developers face during a sprint, and how to best utilize my time to get the most work accomplished without compromising the quality of my code.

The thing I struggled with the most to begin with was learning how to use the Django framework. It was my first time having to learn something "on the fly" like that, having no prior knowledge of what Django was and being relatively new to Python itself. That being said, by the time I finshed the project, having to overcome my biggest challenge was where I learned the most from this project. I feel like this is when I actually felt like a developer by learning a completley new concept quckily and to be able to use what Ive learned and apply to a project, and deliver it right away.

Overall the project was a ton of fun, and great learning experience for many reasons from building a new app, learning a new languange, and working with a team of passionate, like-minded developers.
